ML-Model-Flask-Deployment:-

This is a demo project to elaborate how Machine Learning Models are 
deployed on production using Flask.

Prerequisites:-

You must have Scikit Learn, Pandas and Flask  installed.

Project Structure:-

This project has three major parts :-

iris.py - This contains code fot our Machine Learning model to 
predict Iris flower class based on training data in 'iris.csv' file.

app.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives features details 
through GUI or API calls, computes the predicted value based on 
our model and returns it.

templates - This folder contains the HTML template to allow user
to enter feature details and displays the predicted Iris Flower Species.

Running the project:-

Ensure that you are in the project home directory:-

1. Create the machine learning model by running below command:

python iris.py

This would create a serialized version of our model into a file iris.pkl

2. Run app.py using below command to start Flask API:

python app.py

By default, flask will run on port 5000.

3. Navigate to URL http://localhost:5000 

You should be able to view the homepage.

Enter valid numerical values in all 4 input boxes and hit Predict.

If everything goes well, you should be able to see the predcited 
Iris Flower Species on the HTML page!.
